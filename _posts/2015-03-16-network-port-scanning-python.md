title: Network Port Scanning with Python and NMAP
---


I've recently been reading Violent Python, 
the first few chapters teaches how to build a newtwork scanner to test for open ports across network addresses/

Here is my implementation - https://gist.github.com/garyconstable/5e8aeb369d3eacb16917

As the program finds open ports the Addsses and port gets written to a Mysql Database table.
